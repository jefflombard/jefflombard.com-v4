# jefflombard.com-v4
4th iteration of JeffLombard.com

The purpose of this site is to serve as an aggregator of all projects and learning I am doing in my spare time.

While wrapping up most of the development for this site I ran [web.dev](https://web.dev/). I was pleased when I achieved this rating. It's not all 100's, but I think the [80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) applies here.

## Interesting parts of this codebase.
I wanted to highlight some of my favorite parts of this codebase, so that people viewing this could appreciate the time that went into this site.

### GraphQL

I decided to use `GraphQL`, because I thought it was an easy way to aggregate data from multiple sources into one convenient endpoint. See [When and why to use GraphQL](https://medium.com/@JeffLombardJr/when-and-why-to-use-graphql-24f6bce4839d).

Most of the `GraphQL` stuff is in [/schema](schema)

### React

#### Refs
I had a [valid use case](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) for `refs` and used one to trigger the playing of the video in [src/src/App.js](src/src/App.js)

#### React Router

I'm using React Router, and created the [scenes/](scenes) directory to house components that would show in the main window.

#### Some Dumb Components
([Yes that's a good thing](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).)

I think [BrandedButton](src/src/components/BrandedButton.js) and [BrandedAnchor](src/src/components/BrandedAnchor.js) are some good examples.

### sketch

I did the FrontEnd designs before I touched any code. See [/designs](sketch)

### lodash

The list of filter able tags is autogenerated. I use some convenient `lodash` methods to flatten the list. See: [src/src/scenes/Projects.js](src/src/scenes/Projects.js)

### javascript/es6

Some nice use of higher-order functions `project.filter().map()` in [src/src/components/ProjectsList.js](src/src/components/ProjectsList.js).

### scss

I didn't need a full-fledged grid system because I was using `react-grid-system` so I made this cool little mixin: [media-up($breakpoint)](src/src/styles/grid.scss) and used it in components like [book](src/src/components/Book.scss).

It is essentially just a wrapper around media queries, that accepts breakpoints [sm,md,lg,xl] as an arg. It then uses the globally set value for those breakpoints.
